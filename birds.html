               <h1>Precautions for glass doors</h1>
               <p>There are many precautions when installing glass doors, such as the method of sealing with glass glue. **We need to open the glass glue and load it into the corresponding injection gun. After setting the corresponding operation, hold the injection gun body with the other hand and hold the glue pressing handle, so squeeze a small amount of glass glue and place it Just align the gap of the corresponding inlaid glass door, and grasp the amount of injection well, not too much, not too little.
                There is often more than one glass door, so pay attention to the butt joints between the glass doors. When installing two or more glass plates indoors, a gap of 2-3 mm needs to be reserved for chamfering. After the connected glass plates are positioned and fixed, the glass glue needs to be injected into the corresponding gap. The injection of the glass glue is the same as before. After the glass glue is filled, it is necessary to select a plastic piece of appropriate size and rub it back and forth on both sides of the glass plate, scrape the excess glass glue on the glass plate, and then wipe off the offset printing with a clean rag, so that the glass can be retained to the greatest extent The beauty of the door.</p>
